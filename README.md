# Rails 5 Tutorial

This is a Rails practice project for me to study Ruby on Rails. It's based on the sample application of [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial:Learn Web Development with Rails*](http://www.railstutorial.org/) by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/).

I use [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) with [rbenv-gemset](https://github.com/jf/rbenv-gemset) to manage my ruby environment.


## How to

### Ruby environment

- [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) with [rbenv-gemset](https://github.com/jf/rbenv-gemset)
- local gemset(.gems)
- Ruby version 2.4.1
- Rails version 5.2.1

### Install

```bash
$ cd /project/path
$ gem install bundler
$ bin/bundle install
$ bin/rails server
```
